<br />
General<br />
Find the most frequent integer in an array<br />
Find pairs in an integer array whose sum is equal to 10 (bonus: do it in linear time)<br />
Given 2 integer arrays, determine of the 2nd array is a rotated version of the 1st array. Ex. Original Array A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8} Rotated Array B={5,6,7,8,1,2,3}<br />
Write fibbonaci iteratively and recursively (bonus: use dynamic programming)<br />
Find the only element in an array that only occurs once.<br />
Find the common elements of 2 int arrays<br />
Implement binary search of a sorted array of integers<br />
Implement binary search in a rotated array (ex. {5,6,7,8,1,2,3})<br />
Use dynamic programming to find the first X prime numbers<br />
Write a function that prints out the binary form of an int<br />
Implement parseInt<br />
Implement squareroot function<br />
Implement an exponent function (bonus: now try in log(n) time)<br />
Write a multiply function that multiples 2 integers without using *<br />
HARD: Given a function rand5() that returns a random int between 0 and 5, implement rand7()<br />
HARD: Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of "islands of 1s" (e.g. groups of connecting 1s)<br />
<br />
Strings<br />
Find the first non-repeated character in a String<br />
Reverse a String iteratively and recursively<br />
Determine if 2 Strings are anagrams<br />
Check if String is a palindrome<br />
Check if a String is composed of all unique characters<br />
Determine if a String is an int or a double<br />
HARD: Find the shortest palindrome in a String<br />
HARD: Print all permutations of a String<br />
HARD: Given a single-line text String and a maximum width value, write the function 'String justify(String text, int maxWidth)' that formats the input text using full-justification, i.e., extra spaces on each line are equally distributed between the words; the first word on each line is flushed left and the last word on each line is flushed right<br />
<br />
Trees
Implement a BST with insert and delete functions<br />
Print a tree using BFS and DFS<br />
Write a function that determines if a tree is a BST<br />
Find the smallest element in a BST<br />
Find the 2nd largest number in a BST<br />
Given a binary tree which is a sum tree (child nodes add to parent), write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree<br />
Find the distance between 2 nodes in a BST and a normal binary tree<br />
Print the coordinates of every node in a binary tree, where root is 0,0<br />
Print a tree by levels<br />
Given a binary tree which is a sum tree, write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree<br />
Given a tree, verify that it contains a subtree.<br />
HARD: Find the max distance between 2 nodes in a BST.<br />
HARD: Construct a BST given the pre-order and in-order traversal Strings<br />
<br />
Stacks, Queues, and Heaps<br />
Implement a stack with push and pop functions<br />
Implement a queue with queue and dequeue functions<br />
Find the minimum element in a stack in O(1) time<br />
Write a function that sorts a stack (bonus: sort the stack in place without extra memory)<br />
Implement a binary min heap. Turn it into a binary max heap<br />
HARD: Implement a queue using 2 stacks<br />
<br />
Linked Lists<br />
Implement a linked list (with insert and delete functions)<br />
Find the Nth element in a linked list<br />
Remove the Nth element of a linked list<br />
Check if a linked list has cycles<br />
Given a circular linked list, find the node at the beginning of the loop. Example: A-->B-->C --> D-->E -->C, C is the node that begins the loop<br />
Check whether a link list is a palindrome<br />
Reverse a linked list iteratively and recursively<br />
<br />
Sorting<br />
Implement bubble sort<br />
Implement selection sort<br />
Implement insertion sort<br />
Implement merge sort<br />
Implement quick sort<br />
